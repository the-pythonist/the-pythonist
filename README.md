- Hi, I'm the_pythonist (not pythonista, not pythoneer).

- Been coding in Python since 2018, but somehow I just created a github profile (weird right?). Wish I created and uploaded all my projects since 2018. I've lost so many good projects.

- I’m passionate about Cybersecurity and Hacking. You want to hear a cool thing? Hacking is why I began Python.


- I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python. I've had so many projects that I lost and didn't place on github - hurts me but well, I've got to move on.... :)

- You can reach me via:
