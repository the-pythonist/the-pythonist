- Hi, I'm the_pythonist (not pythonista, not pythoneer).

- Been coding in Python since 2018. 

- Iâ€™m passionate about Cybersecurity and Hacking. You want to hear a cool thing? Hacking is why I began Python :)


- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Python. I've had good projects that I lost and didn't place on github - hurts but well, I've got to move on.... :)

- From now on, any project I work on goes in here. 



### Check out my repositories. If you are a pythonist especially, like me, you may like them ðŸ˜„.
